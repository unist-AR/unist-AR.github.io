# candidates of our ring concepts
We started to evaluate the novelty of joystick inputs in terms of research through papers(related works).<br>
There are isometric joysticks, isotonic joystick, and touchpads.<br>
- An isometric joystick (e.g., the IBM Trackpint) is a force-sensing joystick that returns to center when released.<br>
- Isotonic joysticks sense angle of deflection.<br>
- Touchpads are small, touch-sensitive tablets often found on laptop computers.<br>
There are lots of movement based input device but force input device are usually used as supplementary device.<br>
Force based input is smaller than movement based input so that force based input was more appropriate for small ring.<br>
If you put the touchpad on the ring, it will be very small and you have to do repetitive and discontinuous tasks.<br>
Therefore, we decided to find more works on force based input to evaluate novelty in terms of research.<br>

# Pros and Cons of force based input
## Pros
You can move the cursor without moving your arms. Especially, if you have a sensor on your hand, it can be used without pushing back because it is used in hand.<br>
## Cons
It is difficult for beginners to learn first. Although it is easy to operate in one direction, it is difficult to move the cursor in a circular shape.<br>
