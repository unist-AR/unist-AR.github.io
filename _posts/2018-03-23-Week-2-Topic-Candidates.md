title: Week 2 - Topic Candidates
description: "Investigated AR input devices already available on the market for topic selection"
---

We decided to focus on <span style='font-weight:bold'>HoloLens</span> and came up with ideas about the input system of the device. 

## Topic candidates

We suggested four candidates and got feedbacks from professor.

### 1. Combining thimble with a joystick
Inspired from IBM's TrackPoint (the red one), we thought of putting a control sensor on a thimble-looking device so it isn't too obtrusive but intuitive for the user to move the cursor. 

### 2. Coming up with new gestures
We found out that there were only two types of gestures in using HoloLens, so we wanted to make and evaluate gestures.
> This is probably not a good idea. There is a lot of gesture work out there already and most of the work for gesture interfaces is highly technical. 


### 3. Implementing a trackpad
We thought that having a trackpad on the palm might be useful because the control interface is fixed and therefore makes it easier for the user to move the cursor.
> There's also lots of work on the hand/palm as an input surface. This is a potentially good topic, but you will need read about this area a bit first. Maybe start from this paper and see if other interesting papers cite it (or are cited by it). On body input can be a technically hard topic to work on. 

### 4. Using smartphones (similar to #3)
We believe that people would have smartphones everywhere just like they do now for the next few years, and it would be nice if smartphones could be used as a trackpad.
> Probably not that interesting. Some AR glasses already ship with trackpads. Many VR headsets (e.g. daydream, gear VR) also ship with small trackpads.
