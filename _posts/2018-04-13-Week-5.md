# Why force based input
3D Touch
Isometric (Trackpoint)으로 갔을 때 얼마나 현재 홀로렌즈 인터랙션을 대체할 수 있는지

# Buy components
We started to evaluate the novelty of joystick inputs in terms of research through papers(related works).<br>

1. Trackpoint component (if possible)

# Plan B
Trackpoint has drawback. It popped up in the ring.<br>
Therefore, We considered flexible nail input as a plan B.<br>
Plus, We considered pressure based input as a plan C.<br>
Or plan D with thumbwheel.<br>
