title: Week 1 - Topic Selection
description: "Investigated AR input devices already available on the market for topic selection"
---

In this week, we investigated AR input devices already available on the market for topic selection and share their opinions about what they are interested in. 

## Four interesting categories in AR input devices
Prior to the topic selection, we categorized the AR input devices currently available on the market and picked four interesting items.

### Low wearable  
- A wearable device with minimized body contact  
- Worn on the finger or palm, nail, finch  
- e.g. ring

### Installed 
- A unit device can be added to AR device (Add-on)
- Increase accessibility to AR
- e.g. LEAP motion, GlassPass, WatchThru

### Method / Software
- Designed for non-hardware input method
- e.g. SmoothMoves, Voice UI

### Using daily device as input device
- Utilize mobile device as AR input
- e.g. using smartphone or smartwatch

## Interests

> <cite>Doyeon Kim: </cite>  
Assistive technology, accessible design

> <cite>Heena Kwag: </cite>  
Improve reticle of current AR input method (e.g. HoloLens)

> <cite>Minseop Kim: </cite>  
A. Thumb-on form + twisted interaction (e.g. Finch)  
B. Swipe or touch the panel in one hand with the other hand.  
C. Use smartphone or smartwatch as a controller.  

The common opinion was that it is better to be available in certain situations.
