## Connecting a trackpoint to HoloLens
We shared our idea about the ways to connect HoloLens and a trackpoint. Professor said the first one is better because it can be applied to a trackball as the same way and it is the simplest one to make. Also, he said the last one, making an unity application can access HoloLens and a trackpoint separately, is not a good idea. He recommended developing hardware and software independently.

## The reason why a trackball is also recommended
To do comparative study, features except for the part to be compared should be almost the same. In this regard, trackpoint and trackball are sufficiently similar to compare force and movement.

## Usability -> Evaluation
Usability is measured in application stage. In case of out project, an input device, we have to evaluate it.

## Modified Fitts' law
Fitts' law does not apply to a trackpoint directly because users do not need to move their finger when they are using it. So, we have to modify Fitts' law.

## To-do list for next week

- [ ] Connect trackpoint and trackball to HoloLens
- [ ] Develop experiment application
