# Meeting with professor Oakley - 
Our team narrowed topics into two - a thimble a ring combined with a joystick and attaching a trackpad on the palm. To demonstrate our ideas clearly to professor, we made low-fidelity prototypes out of clay and brought them with us to the meeting.

The professor suggested that we should take a look at previous literature more carefully. He also gave us a list of related papers:

# First presentation

The first presentation was on 30th March, and DoYeon introduced our topic and future plans for the project.<br><br>

#### Introducing HoloLens and why
>- One of 25 TIMES best inventions of 2015<br>
>- Very accurate and precise compared to its competitors<br>
>- Gestures (2 type: click and bloom) and voice input implemented thoroughly<br>

#### Problems with existing input systems
>- Gaze: unstable<br>
>- Pointing gesture: driving attention, arm fatigue<br>
>- Voice input: obtrusive, cannot be used in shared events<br>

#### Related works - solutions
>- Spatialize
>    - Ring device utilizing pointing action
>    - Pointing: obtrusive, interaction is unfamiliar
>- Ring-type device<br>
    - Combining spatial information and gestures using trackpad<br>
    - repetitive movement: exhausting<br>

#### Topic candidates & Research question
>- Pointing interaction is not stable<br>
>- Gesture interaction is obtrusive<br>
>- Trackpad doesnâ€™t match the interaction we want to implement<br>

#### Expected outcomes
>1. Working prototype<br>
>2. Evaluation report assessing performance<br.
