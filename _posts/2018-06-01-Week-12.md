## Unity application
We made an unity application for experiment.
- If a cursor is above the target (gray circle), then it changes its shape from circle to doughnut.
- The target that the user has to click is <span style="color:#00FF00;font-weight:bold">green</span>, clicked target is <span style="color:#0000FF;font-weight:bold">blue</span> and the others are <span style="color:#555555;font-weight:bold">gray</span>.
- The order of targets is referred to <a href="#fitts_law_paper">this paper</a>.
- The position of each targets is reffered to <a href="#pinpoint_paper">this paper</a>.
    + 8 targets are positioned in 45 degrees apart from each other. 
    + Near is 7 degrees and far is 21 degrees from eye position.
- Cursor is controlled by a trackpoint that connected with bluetooth.
