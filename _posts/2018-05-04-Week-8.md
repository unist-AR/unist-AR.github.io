title: Week 8 - More specified problem
description: "We are in Development phase with more specified problems"

We decided to deal with "Selection interaction"
Prof.Ian "You can experiment on the 'selection interaction.' I think it would be better to refer to [this article](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1056155)."

## Hacking keyboard <br>
We found out what 4 pinouts are (SP_X, SP_Y, SP_Z, SP_G) <br>
SP_Y + SP_Z = ↑ <br>
SP_Y + SP_G = ↓ <br>
SP_X + SP_Z = ← <br>
SP_X + SP_G = → <br>

Prof.Ian guess 2 of 4 are related to power and ground(GND) <br>
We concluded that Trackpoint can not be used without a existing IC chip. <br>

## Go with Plan B at the same time <br>
We soldered trackball input. <br>
We are going to connect <br>
1. hacked keyboard - Arduino + A type USB-host shield <br>
2. Arduino + Bluetooth module - Hololens  <br>
